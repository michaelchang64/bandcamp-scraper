# Janky Bandcamp Web Scraper

This bad boy can download so many mp3's from Bandcamp!!!

I wrote this while procrastinating on my other psets because learning how to webscrape with Python was *clearly* more important.

After you download all the dependencies (actually just `pip install bs4` and you're good lmao), Run it like so:
```
python3 bandcamp_scrape.py "your_url.bandcamp.com/blahblah" "/file/path/to/store/mp3s/in"
```

Please don't arrest me or report me for piracy, I only did this for educational purposes.

Also, if you `insPecT thE ElEmenTS` carefully enough, you'll see that Bandcamp has a [lax policy](https://bandcamp.com/zendesk/help/audio_basics#steal).

Hope you enjoy this! DO SUPPORT GROWING ARTISTS BY BUYING THEIR MUSIC!!!!!!!
